# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation from previous development iterations. These files are preserved for reference but represent abandoned approaches or outdated project states.

## Abandoned Experiments

### Scoring System (Abandoned November 2025)
- `SCORING_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis showing scorers failed to predict winners
- `SCORING_SYSTEM_FIXES.md` - Attempted fixes for data and filtering issues
- `SCORING_SYSTEM_VERDICT.md` - Final decision to abandon scoring approach

**Why Abandoned:** Empirical testing showed losers scored HIGHER than winners (6.83 vs 6.69). All candidates passing base screening also passed scoring thresholds, making the system redundant. Decision: Use simple adaptive volume filter instead.

## Outdated Project Documentation

### Momentum Hunter Project (January 2025)
- `PROGRESS.md` - Vision for "Momentum Hunter" AI trading system
- `SESSION_HISTORY.md` - Development sessions from January 2025

**Status:** These docs describe an earlier project iteration called "Momentum Hunter" which has since evolved into the current LongEdge daily breakout strategy. Kept for historical reference but no longer reflects current system design.

**Note:** Current project documentation is in `/long-edge/README.md` and `/long-edge/docs/`
